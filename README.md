What are the goals, projects or milestones of 🗺️Ion Core 👯👯 👛 project?
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

We are very fresh and new, so far a lot if not most has to be defined/redefined. Now is great moment for everybody to [contribute, regardless of your skills or abillities](https://cevap.github.io/doc/GitAccess.html), blockchain and crypto technology should connect people and not complicate additionally anything! [Connecting People](assets/images/3rdparty/But2me.png?raw=true "Community")

Currently ion community is used to have their communication/PR primarly on their [ionomy's Slack channel](http://ionomy.slack.com/) which is not very transparent, especially for those who do not sit permanently in that channel, like people who are interesting to join. There are different community based projects like [ion.community forum](https://ion.community/), as well other projects. Most of them are in control of somebody but not a community and I (CEVAP) do assume that we could call it closed source, especially if it is only available to ionomy ltd. 

We want to build up and provide transparent way of collaborating, eve for n(.)(.)bs, releasing, announcing, planning, ... should be easy and as far automated as possible. Maybe most important line to hold on is to choose reliable services with strong dependency not to produce any cost at all, just like GitHub. Everything published by CEVAP is and will be released under [MIT License](LICENSE) unless there are some licensing restrictions of different source projects.

Currently all links and work done is more something like a pilot workshop. This project as well as it's management will change in time by the amount of contributors and changing technologies of how to handle/maintenance such projects like CEVAP.
